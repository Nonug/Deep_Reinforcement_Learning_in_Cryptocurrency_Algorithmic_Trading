# Deep Reinforcement Learning in Cryptocurrency Algorithmic Trading :chart_with_upwards_trend:

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

numpy<br/>
pandas<br/>
Matplotlib<br/>
gym<br/>
tqdn<br/>
tabulate<br/>
torch<br/>
tensorboard<br />

## Usage

### Testing existing trained model

1. Run cells in `test_prototype_and_classics.ipynb` to show EDA, test the performance of the non-AI strategies and DQN agent trained from interim prototype.
2. Run cells in `testStrategy_finalworks.ipynb` to test the performance of the 3 RL agents trained from our final work.
3. The evaluation metrics will be shown in the jupyter notebook and the figures will be stored in `tdqn_final/Figures`and `tdqn_prototype/Figures`

### Training new models and optimisation (not recommended)

1. Run the notebooks in `tdqn_final` or `tdqn_prototype` to train the models, the trained models will be stored in their `tdqn/Strategies`
2. The instructions are stated in the jupyter notebook
3. It is not recommended as hours are required to retrain the model
