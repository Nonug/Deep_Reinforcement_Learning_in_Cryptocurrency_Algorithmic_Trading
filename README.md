# Deep Reinforcement Learning in Cryptocurrency Algorithmic Trading


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
numpy<br/>
pandas<br/>
Matplotlib<br/>
gym<br/>
tqdm<br/>
tabulate<br/>
torch<br/>
etherscan<br/>

## Usage
1. Run the jupyter notebooks in `tdqn` to construct the tdqn model

## version
version for interim prototype
* action space = 2
* state = ['Close',"Low","High","Volume","s2f"]
* basic TDQN 
* no eth test because haven't scraped eth s2f
* experiments on different network can be carry out by including network in the training param
