# Deep Reinforcement Learning in Cryptocurrency Algorithmic Trading

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
numpy<br/>
pandas<br/>
Matplotlib<br/>
gym<br/>
tqdm<br/>
tabulate<br/>
torch<br/>
tensorboard<br />

## Usage
### Testing existing trained model
1. Run all cells in `tdqn/testStrategy.ipynb` to test the performance of the three existing trained model
2. The evaluation metrics will be shown in the jupyter notebook and the figures will be stored in `tdqn/Figures`

### Training new models and optimisation (not recommended)
1. Run the cells in `tdqn/tdqn.ipynb` to train the models, the trained models will be stored in `tdqn/Strategies`
2. The instructions are stated in the jupyter notebook
3. It is not recommended as hours are required to retrain the model
